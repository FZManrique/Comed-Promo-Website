                  <summary>TEACHERS' DAY</summary>
                  <p>
                    Last October 5, 2022, the SSG decided to organize a simple
                    celebration for Teachers' Day. The day was filled with
                    entertaining events. Students displayed their talents as a
                    simple present for their teachers. The Grade 10 students
                    performed a band, while the Grades 7, 8 and 9 showed their
                    dancing prowess. The advisers and subject teachers received
                    gifts from the students. Each sections gathered in their
                    classrooms to celebrate together with their classmates. They
                    prepared a small surprise for their adviser and brought
                    foods to share. The day was surely enjoyable for both the
                    students and teachers.

                  <p>
                    Last year, on the 27th of October, the high school
                    celebrated Sci-Math Day! Students and teachers were having
                    fun. They're shouting their yells and chants. Solving
                    equations and answering simple questions is one of the
                    events in Sci-Math Day. Some students from different houses
                    express their talent in dancing and singing. The students
                    and also the teachers surely enjoyed the amazing event.

                  <p>
                    Last year, from November 28 to December 1, we had our most
                    anticipated intramurals. It was a week of spectacular
                    events. We had physical activities like zumba, a color fun
                    run, and outdoor and indoor games. Students showed their
                    talents and spirit of sportsmanship. The weeklong
                    celebration ended with the students' night, which the
                    students enjoyed with their friends and classmates.
